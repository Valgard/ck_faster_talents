# Required env vars (set in .envrc):
#   UNITY_BIN          Path to the Unity Editor binary (Unity 6000.0.59f2)
#   SDK_PATH           Path to the cloned Pugstorm CoreKeeperModSDK
#   MOD_INSTALL_PATH   Destination folder Pugstorm's ModBuilder writes to
#
# On macOS, this also runs scripts/install-macos.sh after the build to apply
# the CrossOver/Wine workaround. Set SKIP_MACOS_INSTALL=1 to opt out.

# Exit codes:
#   0  Build succeeded (and on macOS, install step also succeeded)
#   1  Env var missing or invalid path
#   2  Unity returned non-zero (build failure or Unity crash)
#   3  macOS install step failed
