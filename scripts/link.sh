# scripts/link.sh — Idempotently symlink the mod into the shared SDK clone.
#
# The mod's canonical files live in this repo under `unity/`, laid out as a
# 1:1 mirror of the SDK's `Assets/` tree. This script links that mirror into
# the SDK clone so Unity builds against it:
#
#   $SDK_PATH/Assets/FasterTalents            -> unity/FasterTalents/   (dir symlink)
#   $SDK_PATH/Assets/FasterTalents.asset      -> unity/FasterTalents.asset
#   $SDK_PATH/Assets/FasterTalents.asset.meta -> unity/FasterTalents.asset.meta
#   $SDK_PATH/Assets/FasterTalents.meta       -> unity/FasterTalents.meta
#
# The single directory symlink captures every file inside the mod folder —
# including ones the Unity Editor adds later — so nothing has to be wired up
# here by hand. The three Assets-level files sit beside the mod folder (the
# ModBuilderSettings asset + the folder's own .meta) and need their own links.
#
# Required env vars (set in .envrc):
#   SDK_PATH   Path to the cloned Pugstorm CoreKeeperModSDK
#
# The symlinks encode an absolute path, so they dangle after a worktree
# switch or repo move. `build.sh` re-runs this on every build; run it
# standalone only when iterating on the SDK side outside of `build.sh`.
